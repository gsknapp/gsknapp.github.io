<h2>Number Theory</h2>

<p>Most of my research attention is devoted
to number theory from an analytic perspective (which is different from
analytic number theory), where my interests include Diophantine
approximation, Thue equations,
polynomial root separation, and other topics.</p>

You can find my full research statement here (intended for all
mathematicians, but please reach out if you have questions about
something)!<br>

<h3>Talks</h3>

<p>I have given several versions of the same talk on my research into
Thue equations.
&nbsp;All have been titled something like "Bounds on the Number of
Solutions to Thue's Inequality."
&nbsp;The slides for the best version of the talk (which was given
in the PIMS Emergent Research Seminar on October 11, 2023) are
here:&nbsp;<a href="files/thue_equation_talk.pdf">thue_equation_talk.pdf</a>.&nbsp;
Moreover, the talk was recorded, and you can view the talk here: <a href="https://mathtube.org/lecture/video/bounds-number-solutions-thue-equations">https://mathtube.org/lecture/video/bounds-number-solutions-thue-equations</a>.<br>
</p>

<p>While I have given talks about my work on polynomial root
separation, none of them contain the substantial progress I made with
Chi Hoi Yip in the paper above.&nbsp; As such, I won't link to any
slides or recordings here.</p>

I spoke about my research on products of powers of algebraic integer
conjugates (joint work with Seda Albayrak, Samprit Ghosh, and Khoa
Nguyen)
at the most recent Alberta Number Theory Days conference at the Banff
International Research Station on March 23, 2024.&nbsp; You can find
the slides here: <a href="files/exp_inequalities_talk.pdf">exp_inequalities_talk.pdf</a>.&nbsp;
